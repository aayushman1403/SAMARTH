# SAMARTH

**SAMARTH** is a comprehensive urban safety intelligence platform designed to assist law enforcement and enhance public safety in Mumbai. Developed as part of an academic research project, SAMARTH integrates machine learning, secure storage, and advanced data visualization to tackle pressing safety challenges across urban landscapes.

## 🔍 Project Overview

SAMARTH consists of five key modules that collectively enable proactive policing, digital citizen engagement, and tamper-proof evidence handling:

1. **Mumbai Safety Zone Prediction**
   - Predicts hourly crime intensity across Mumbai’s 24 municipal wards.
   - Interactive heatmap helps optimize police patrolling and resource allocation.

2. **Crime Case Prioritization**
   - Analyzes FIR data and ranks cases based on urgency using machine learning.
   - Streamlit dashboard and visual analytics provide actionable insights.

3. **Online Complaint Filing with Supabase Integration**
   - Allows users to submit complaints via a secure web interface.
   - Media evidence is securely stored in Supabase with access control.

4. **Decentralized Evidence Storage with IPFS**
   - Evidence files are pinned to IPFS via the Pinata API.
   - Content Identifiers (CIDs) ensure immutability and traceability.

5. **Multimodal Anomaly Detection**
   - Verifies uploaded media using metadata, frequency analysis, edge consistency, and clarity checks.
   - Flags potentially tampered files for manual review.
